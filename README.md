# Mission Data Engineering

## Overview
Mission Data Engineering is a hands-on project focused on real-time data processing using Apache Spark and AWS S3. The project is designed to simulate a production-ready data engineering environment, providing deep insights into real-world data workflows.

## Project Goals
- Efficiently process large volumes of data using Apache Spark.
- Implement data transformation pipelines for structured analysis.
- Store and retrieve data using AWS S3.
- Optimize SQL queries for improved performance.
- Automate workflows with CI/CD pipelines.

## Prerequisites
To set up and run this project, ensure you have the following:
- A laptop with at least **4GB RAM and an i3 processor** (recommended: **8GB RAM and an i5 processor**).
- Apache Spark installed locally (setup instructions provided in the documentation).
- **Python 3.10.11** (recommended over older versions like 3.6 or 3.9).
- **PyCharm** as the IDE.

## How to Run the Project in PyCharm
1. Open PyCharm.
2. Clone or upload the project from GitHub.
3. Open the terminal in PyCharm.
4. Navigate to the virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   cd venv
   cd Scripts
   activate   # (use ./activate if the command doesn't work)
   ```
5. Create `main.py` as per the project structure.
6. Set up an AWS user with S3 full access and configure the access keys in the config file.
